# JavaScript Password Generator 

## A password is generated randomly using a JavaScript. User is prompted for how many characters he wants his/her password.

### We have asked user to enter the values for a password via prompt window. The minimum criteria is 8 and the maximum criteria is 128 characters in length. If they enter lower than 8 or higher than 128, prompt window asks to try again.

### The App asks user to choose numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase. And once all the prompt's are done, a password is generated on the screen.
